export const rules = `Players take alternate turns, starting with player 1. Multiple pieces cannot occupy the same cell. A piece cannot move through a cell that is not empty. If a piece moves into the same cell as an enemy piece, it captures it. Disallow any move that threatens a friendly king. If a player cannot move and their king is threatened, end the game with their loss. If a player cannot move and their king is not threatened, end the game with a draw. If a king is threatened at the start of a turn, say "Check".`;
